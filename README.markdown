Evolve Image
============

This is an attempt to implement something like
[http://alteredqualia.com/visualization/evolve/][1] and [http://rogeralsing.com/2008/12/07/genetic-programming-evolution-of-mona-lisa/][2] in Objective-C using just the
GNUStep/Cocoa Foundation Library. Ultimately it is to be multithreaded in an attempt
to evolve an image a quickly as possible, particularly on multi core machines.
